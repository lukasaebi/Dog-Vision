# Dog-Vision

This is a multi-class image classifier project using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The goal of this project was to get to know an end-to-end image recognition project workflow. 

Given a picture of a dog, the model should be able to determine what kind of dog breed it shows. There are 120 types of dog breeds (-> 120 classes in the target variable) and 10'000+ images for both train and test set. The model has a multiclass logloss of 0.86 on the test set.
